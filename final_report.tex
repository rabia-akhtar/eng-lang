\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What is The English Language Language?}

In 2010, nearly one out of three college students across the United States reported having plagiarized assignments from the Internet, and about 10\% of college students have plagiarized work at least once from another student. These shocking statistics reveal the prevalent issue of plagiarism across schools in the country, as well as around the world, and we wanted to find a way to battle it. 
\newline \newline
The English Language language solves problems specific to document manipulation and data extrapolation. In traditionally utilized languages, it is often difficult to write scripts that can analyze multiple documents quickly, and can cross-compare them. Storing a document itself is tough, but on top of that, being able to compare multiple documents at once is very rare. Our unique language provides core file manipulation operations and storage structures, which allow us to mine statistics that will check for plagiarism between given documents, as well as other tasks related to document manipulation. This is especially useful for teaching, grading, publishing, and other such projects and work. We hope to facilitate the efforts of teachers and publishers by offering them this service that will allow them to check for plagiarism quickly and easily, without having to peruse hundreds of documents manually.

\section{Usage}
This is a brief overview on how to use our language, including writing, compiling, and running your .ell program. \newline

\subsection{Getting Started}
First, download the language project folder onto your local system. In your terminal, move into this directory, and then move further into the \textit{english-llvm} subdirectory. You are all set to start running your own ELL programs!

\subsection{Writing Your Program}
Create a new file using your favorite text editor, with the extension \textit{.ell}. As a demonstration, let us start with a simple "Hello World" program, named helloworld.ell. Here is what the program looks like: \newline
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
// helloworld.ell
int main() {
    print_string("hi world");
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Compiling}
Make sure you are in the \textit{eng-lang-master/english-llvm} directory. Type the command \textit{make} in your terminal window, which will generate our ELL compiler. Then, run the following command in your shell:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
 \$ 
\end{lstlisting}

\newpage
\section{Language Tutorial}
Now we can get started with writing more complicated programs. The English Language language allows for various data types, structures, functions, and other such implementations. Here we will give an overview of each one, as well as sample code to demonstrate its usage.
\subsection{Integer}
Various operations can be performed on integers in ELL, such as basic arithmetic operations. Below is an example of simple addition between integers:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int sum = 3 + 5;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{String}

\subsection{Array}

\subsection{Struct}

\subsection{Variable Declaration}

\subsection{For Loop}

\subsection{While Loop}

\subsection{If/else Statement}

\subsection{Library Functions}
ELL utilizes several library functions, including strcmp(), open(), and close(). A full list of all available library functions are detailed later, and any of these can be utilized simply by calling the function name and passing in the appropriate input. Here is an example implementation of the strcmp() function. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
if (strcmp(words[1], words[2]) == 0)
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Project Plan}
\subsection{Process}
As a team, we started from Stephen Edwards' MicroC compiler shown in class. After ensuring our understanding of it, we edited it to produce an output of "hello world". Once that stage in the programming was completed, we began building off of this new compiler to implement the various types, structures, and functions we needed for our own language. We split up the work based on how difficult each section seemed, as well as on our role designations at the beginning of the semester, while also continuing to help each other throughout the process.

\subsection{Project Timeline}

\newpage
\section{Architectural Design}
Our compiler begins with the source code, passes that through the scanner and tokenizes it. This output is then passed through a parser, from which an abstract syntax tree is constructed. Then, the semantic analyzer checks the semantics of the program to detect any issues in structures, declarations, arguments, etc., and then passes that output through the code generator. Finally, this output is translated into LLVM code.

\section{Test Plan}
Here we demonstrate three programs written in ELL that demonstrate most of the functionalities of our language.

\subsection{Sort Names}
The following program demonstrates an example of how an instructor can sort their students' names in alphabetical order, by implementing mergesort on a list of strings.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
// sortnames.ell

/* merge sort helper function*/
int merge_helper(int a[], int l, int m, int r){

int n1 = m-l +1;
int n2 = r -m;
int left [n1];
int right [n2];

int i; 
int j;

/* copy data to temporary arrays */
for(i =0; i <n1; i = i+1){
  left[i] = a[1 + i];
}
for(j =0; j<n2; j= j+1){
  right[j] = a[m +1 + j];
}

/* merge arrays */
i = 0;
j = 0;
int k = 1;

while ( i < n1 && j< n2){

    if (strcmp(left[i],right[j]) > 0){
      a[k] = left[i];
      i = i +1;
    }
    else{
      a[k] = r[j];
      j = j+1;
    }
    k = k + 1;
    }

    /* copy remainder of left */
    while (i <n1){

    a[k] = left[i];
    i = i +1;
    k = k+1;
    }

    /* copy remainder of right */
    while(j <n2){
    a[k] = right[j];
    j = j+1;
    k = k+1;
    }
   return 0;
}

/* merge sort function */
int merge_sort(string a[], int l, int r){
  if(l <r){
    int m = l+r/2;
    merge_sort(a, l, m);
    merge_sort(a, m+1, r);

    merge_helper(a, l, m, r);
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  string [] test;
  test = ["emily", "rabia", "nvita", "michele", "candace"];
  merge_sort(test);
  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Word Count}
The following program demonstrates an example of how an instructor can see which students remained within the word count limit for an assignment.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
// follow_word_count.ell

/* student struct*/
struct Student {
	string Name;
	string Essay;
};

/* function checks if a string is 100 words or under */
int follows_word_count(string essay){

	int words = word_count(essay);
	if (words < 101){
		return 1;
	}
	return 0;
}

/* function reads in a file and returns the content in string format */
string import_essay(string file_name){
	string s1 = calloc(1, 2000);
	file_ptr fp = open("tests/hello.txt", "rb");
   	int size = read(s1, 1, 2000, fp);
   	close(fp);
   	return s1;	
}


int main(){
	/* declare array of students who submitted an essay */
	struct Student [5] students;

	struct Student candice;
	candice.Name = "Candace";
	candice.Essay = import_essay("candace_essay.txt");
	students[0] = candace;

	struct Student emily;
	emily.Name = "Emily";
	emily.Essay = import_essay("emily_essay.txt");
	students[1] = emily;

	struct Student michele;
	michele.Name = "Michele";
	michele.Essay = import_essay("michele_essay.txt");
	students[2] = michele;

	struct Student nvita;
	nvita.Name = "Nvita";
	nvita.Essay = import_essay("nvita_essay.txt");
	students[3] = nvita;

	struct Student rabia;
	rabia.Name = "Rabia";
	rabia.Essay = import_essay("rabia_essay.txt");
	students[4] = rabia;

	/* check which students followed the word count */
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i< 5; i = i + 1){
		if(follows_word_count(students[i].Essay) == 1){
			print_string(students[i].Name);
			print_string("'s essay follows the word count.");
		}
		else{
			print_string(students[i].Name);
			print_string("'s essay has too many words.");
		}
	}

	/* free allocated memory */
   	free(candace.Essay);
   	free(emily.Essay);
   	free(michele.Essay);
   	free(nvita.Essay);
   	free(rabia.Essay);

	return(0);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Plagiarism}
The following program demonstrates an example of how someone can detect plagiarism between documents. The code has two functions, one for finding top word count and one for finding common top word counts between data sets, in order to check for similarity between two documents.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
// plagiarism.ell

/* struct for keeping track of word frequency */
struct WordFreq{
	    string [100] Top_words;
	    int[100] Top_counts;
	};

/* function returns top int top number of most frequent words in string, exclusing common stop words */
string [] relevant_words(string essay, int top){
	
	int size = word_count(essay);

	string [size] words; 

	/* todo */
	words = split_at(essay, " ", words);

	/* count the frequency of each word in the text document and store in count */
	/* still considering a data structure for this */

	int [size] count;

	int i;
	int j;
	int found = 0;
	string current;

	for (i = 0; i < size; i = i + 1){
		current = words[i]; 
		/* don't count stop words */
		if (is_stop_word(current) == 0){
		for (j = 0; j< size; j = j+1){
		    /* check if same word has been found */
			if (found == 0){
	    		if (strcmp(current, words[j]) == 0){ 
	    			found = 1;
	    			count [j]++;
	    		}
			}
		}
		found = 0;
	
	}
	}

	/* find top words */
	struct WordFreq word_freq;

	int max = 0;
	int max_index = 0; 
	string max_word;
	int k;

	for (k = 0; k< top; k = k +1){
		for (i = 0; i < size; i = i + 1){
			if (max < count[i]){
				int present = 0;
				for (j = 0; j<top; j = j+1){ 
					/* check if value already put in top words */
					if (count[i] == word_freq.top_counts[j]){	    					if (string_compare(words[i] == word_freq.top_words[j])){
							present = 1;
					}
					}
				}
				if(present == 0){ 
					max_index = i;
					max = count[i];

				}
		}
		}

		word_freq.top_words[k] = words[max_index];
		word_freq.top_counts[k] = count[max_index];
		max = 0;
	    	}
	 return word_frequency.Top_words;
}

/* check for simlarity of content between two files, takes in top, top i words are compared, returns number of common top words. */
int check_similar(string file1, string file2, int top){

	/* find relevant words in each document */
	/* the hard coded numbers can be changed or made input */ // input would be ideal
	string [top] relevant1 = find_relevant(file1, top); 
	string [top] relevant2 = find_relevant(file2, top);

	/* check for similarity in content */
	int i;
	int j;
	int similar = 0;
	for(i = 0; i< top; i = i + 1){
		for(j = 0; j< top; j = j + 1){
			if(strcmp(relevant1[i], relevant2[i]) == 0){				
			similar = similar + 1; 
			}
		}
	}

	return similar;
	}

int main(){

	string s1 = calloc(1, 2000);
	file_ptr fp1 = open(file_name, "rb");
	int size1 = read(s1, 1, 2000, fp);
	close(fp1);

	string s2 = calloc(1, 2000);
	file_ptr fp2 = open(file_name, "rb");
	int size2 = read(s1, 1, 2000, fp);
	close(fp2);

	int result = check_similarity(s1, s2, 30);

	print(result);

	free(s1);
	free(s2);
	return 0;

}
